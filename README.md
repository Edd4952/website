Hey everyone, this is my website portfolio showcasing all of my skills and projects related to my career in computer science.

It is a work in progress and is certainly not perfect.

It includes all important contact information including my email, phone number, linkedin, resume, and github profile.

I always plan on adding to it when I complete a project, but it may not always be up to date.

Thanks for stopping by!
